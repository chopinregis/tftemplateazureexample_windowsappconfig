# Azure Windows Application Configuration

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying Windows applications in Azure, demonstrating advanced infrastructure as code (IaC) practices. It's designed to showcase scalable and efficient management of Windows-based cloud environments, making it an invaluable resource for companies focusing on automation and cloud governance.

## Repository Contents

- **YAML Configuration**: Define and manage application specifications such as name, OS type, and SKU in a YAML file, simplifying updates and scalability.
- **Terraform Modules**: Use Terraform to dynamically create Azure resources based on the applications listed in the YAML configurations.
- **Resource Management**: Automated setup of Azure resource groups and service plans specific to Windows applications, configured for optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Utilizes Terraform's `for_each` to deploy multiple service plans and applications based on predefined YAML configurations.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to update and maintain through simple changes in the YAML file, which are directly reflected in the cloud infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Designed for scalability, allowing easy addition of more applications or adjustments to existing configurations without significant restructuring.
